            <p>It seems like these days just about everything is unaffordable. Rent, energy, and food has all risen in the past 12 months according to the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics’Consumer Price Index (CPI). Food alone has risen by 3.1 percent over the last year.  </p>

</p>While inflation and recent tariffs implemented on countries that produce food like bananas, meat, and coffee have tightened Americans’ purse strings this year, food insecurity over the past three years has <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PkVtAEUcAJICT94SIciDEmElyl-UMgWItN-Uhwwv2OU/edit?gid=699157133#gid=699157133">steadily risen</a>
in all five boroughs. The number of SNAP recipients in the city has also increased by <a href="ttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PkVtAEUcAJICT94SIciDEmElyl-UMgWItN-Uhwwv2OU/edit?gid=897497987#gid=897497987">3.51%</a> since July 2023. This trend reflects the growing affordability crisis many New Yorkers face in an already expensive city.</p>

</p>Governmental programs like SNAP are a keystone in filling in the gap of food insecure households, but when the government shutdown lasted 41 days from October 1st to November 12th, SNAP benefits across the country were halted. </p>

</p>“There's no way the New York City food pantry system could step up to fill the gap of SNAP,” said Kira Garfinkel, senior development manager at the West Side Campaign Against Hunger, or WSCAH for short. “It's just a huge gap percentage-wise in terms of how much food we provide versus what SNAP provides,” he explained. </p>

</p>WSCAH is the largest food pantry system in New York City. During the government shutdown, the pantry saw up to a 90 percent increase in foot traffic. Even after the government shutdown ended and SNAP benefits were restored, Garfinkel says the number of fully employed people using the food pantry points to a “disturbing” trend. </p>

            “What it says to me is that at this point, there are some people who effectively in their minds, like the only way that I can afford my life, it's, I've tried everything. I have the jobs, I'm working, I've cut costs everywhere I can, I still need the pantry. That's not a great situation. That shouldn't be true for so many people,” said Garfinkel. </p>

</p>Food security, as defined by the New York City Department of Health, means access by all household members at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life. This also includes the “ready availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods and the ability to consistently and reliably acquire suitable foods without having to rely on emergency food supplies, or other coping strategies.” </p>

</p>The data shows that the food insecure population in each borough has steadily climbed. The Bronx, the most food insecure borough, went from 20.3 percent of the population facing food insecurity in 2023 to 25 percent in 2025. In Brooklyn, the most densely populated borough, food insecurity increased by nearly four percent. 
Even in Staten Island, the least populated borough, food insecurity increased by three percent. </p>

</p>On November 14th, President Trump announced an Executive Order that the government will exempt some key imports, such as beef, bananas, and cocoa from some countries, as grocery prices rise, but Americans may not feel that relief right away, according to CNBC reporting. </p>

</p>“The effects of this executive order will not be felt by consumers for an extended period of time,” Phil Kafarakis, CEO of the food industry association, International Facility Management Association, told CNBC.</p>
